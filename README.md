# Market-Data-Processing-System

1. Time Estimate: Approximately 80-120 hours
2. Description: Build a system that consumes and processes real-time market data feeds.
   - Design an efficient data ingestion mechanism — performing data cleansing and normalization, and implementing algorithms for data analysis (e.g. calculating price/volume trends, volatility, or liquidity metrics).
   - Handle data normalization, compression, and storage. Implement efficient data structures for high-performance data processing.
   - Extra: Build a scalable and robust market data processing system that can handle high volumes of real-time market data.
   - Consider distributed computing techniques and big data technologies.
3. Getting Started: Familiarize yourself with market data formats and sources, as well as socket programming in C++ and the TCP/IP or UDP protocols.
   - Explore data processing libraries and tools in your chosen language.
   - Design a data processing pipeline that efficiently ingests and processes real-time market data feeds.
   - Implement data compression techniques, consider memory management strategies, and leverage high-performance data structures.
